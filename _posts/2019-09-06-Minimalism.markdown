#   Minimalism and me: a nine month journey

**nine months ago, I broke up with my partner and moved out of the house we had owned together for over three years.**  household items were split, finances untangled and just over a month later (on this day seven months ago) I was sat in a new place I was renting surrounded by thirty-two years of purchases in boxes.

It was overwhelming, and brought out anxiety that I had never had in myself before in my life.

During this time, I began to rediscover podcasts and set at reorganising myself and getting myself back on the road of habit building I had let fall by the wayside.  I dived back into my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu classes.  I doubled down on my bouldering.

I came across The Minimalists podcast, and Marie Kondo appeared on Netflix telling me to thank items for bringing me joy.

Going from room to room in my new house, I realised I was wearing everything in this house like a massive oversized, overweight coat dragging me down and causing me stress.  How did I end up with all of these items? How did I end up with so much stuff I **"might"** need, hell, I ended up with things deep down I knew I would never need, but kept **"just in case"**.

Deep introspection along with the advice of Josh and Ryan of [**The Minimalists**](https://www.theminimalists.com/) led me to go from room to room and begin to shed items I did not need, did not want.  I filled bag after bag of books I deep down knew I never would read or would never read again.  I took photos of it all and sent it to family and friends and offered them up for free, and when people wanted to pay I declined accepting at most, a beer or coffee next time we were out.

I gave away hundreds of books.  Many are on my friends shelves and in their hands being enjoyed and lived again.  Some I remember, most I don't which led me to believe that they had given me everything that they could.  I gave away most of my kitchenware, which to my friends was big, they know I love to cook and this was just as big as giving away my books.  I realised that the joy in cooking is not having all the appliances but in being able to do more with less.  I counted up all the items I had in the kitchen post move.  I had four frying pans, two casserole pots, two cast iron skillets, and god knows how many unitasker gadgets that really only saved you seconds.  I shed most of these, gave good quality equipment to friends and instead of feeling loss of useful things I felt joy in giving useful things to others to create better food in the kitchen.

Living with less has improved my life by making me feel less cluttered.  If I want to read I don't feel daunted by the shelves bearing down on me but feel liberated knowing the next book is the one I have with me now, and when I get the next one that book will be passed onto a friend or charity.  Understanding that the book itself isn't the gift or the knowledge but what has flowed through you during the read and what knowledge has been caught in the net that is yourself.  Finishing a book and passing it to a friend that may enjoy or need the words that are kept inside is just as fantastic as the read itself.  The discussion afterwards contacting you more than before.

I still am clearing out my life.  The big chunks are gone, and the smaller sections are cleared slowly but thoughtfully and with each box sent to charity or sold on eBay I feel closer to what I actually want to do with my life rather than surrounding myself with walls of what I think define me, and give a picture of who I am to someone who may or may not visit my home.

Breaking the cycle of filling my home with things that **"define me"** has slowed down my consumption making me engage with what I already have around me at a much higher rate than I did before.

Minimalism isn't for everyone, but everyone should read about minimalism.
