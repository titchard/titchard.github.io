# This Week in Reading & Watching (30th of September to 6th of October 2019)

**Once again, a week bouncing across the board** but not as much reading going on as it has been a busy week.  All I know that October means ghost stories.

**Collected Ghost Stories - MR James** [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/collected-ghost-stories/m-r-james/darryl-jones/9780199674893)

It's October, its the truly the beginning of early nights, frost-bitten mornings and moving yourself closer to the hearth for warmth.  Also, it means spooky reading.  I was inspired to pick this up after [listening to the 2000AD Offical Podcast](https://2000ad.com/podcast) and it being mentioned as the inspiration behind some of the stories that had been made back in the 1970s/80s.  It's definitely that gothic fiction that always seems to capture both the horror of the unknown and the stiff upper lip of Victorian Britain.

**Vice - Christian Bale, Steve Carrell, Amy Adams (2018)** 

Following on from THE BIG SHORT, another dramatic telling of real life events with a darkly comedic and satiric look into the life of Dick Cheney, from his days as a manual worker through to his position as the most powerful Vice President in American History.

Both funny and shocking in equal measure, it really makes you question who has the power in political circles.  Whilst I wouldn't take this as the only source on the subject it is definitely a great starting point.

**Joker - Joaquin Pheonix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy (2019)** 

An exceptionally dark and straight take on the opposing force to Batman, taking you down an uncomfortable trek into the life of the repressed, downtrodden and ignored.

Beautifully shot, the long cinematography makes you look into the eyes of Arthur as you sit squirming awkwardly as it hangs on him, forcing you to look at him, and see what what he is becoming as everyone around him ignores his plight.

Touching on so many different films from TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY, even to AMERICAN PYSCHO (moreso the book than the film) for the delusional aspects.

By the end I felt that I didn't truly know what was true and what was Arthurs delusion, or infact the lies he has been told by the people in his life but I know I felt it was a brilliant rendition of someone with nothing to lose.
