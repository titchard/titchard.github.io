# This Week in Reading (23 to 29th of September 2019)

**This week has been a mixed collection of reading** across a few different genres, and has delved into trashy sci-fi, epic space opera and public shaming.

**Aliens Omnibus ONE - Steve & Stefani Perry** [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-complete-aliens-omnibus-volume-1/steve-perry/stephani-perry/9781783299010)

Huge fan of the films, and the Dark Horse graphic novels are also a great expansion on the universe so I thought I would delve into the officially licensed novels that expand the universe.

Firstly, they are (and I mean this in the nicest terms) true trashy sci-fi.  It's popcorn chomping, brainless action but I will give it credit that the three books in this omnibus take the universe of Alien in directions that the films wouldn't (or cannot) and it does propose some great story lines and ideas, such as the Earth Hive book in this omnibus.

**The Ballad of Halo Jones Volume ONE - Alan Moore** [2000AD Store](https://shop.2000ad.com/catalogue/GRN627)

On my radar for some time, I managed to pick this up recently and read it all in one sitting.  A beautiful beginning to something that feels that it will be huge.  Having watch the 2000AD documentary recently [Reviewed here in the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/03/future-shock-the-story-of-2000ad-review-comic-judge-dredd) it was sad to see that Halo Jones was originally planned for nine books, but only three were finished due to what appears to be disagreements between Moore and 2000AD. I still plan to finish the three books and have the second arriving in the post soon.

**So You've Been Publicly Shamed - Jon Ronson** [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/so-youve-been-publicly-shamed/jon-ronson/9780330492294)

Lent to me by a friend, this interesting collection of people and events regarding their treatment by the public online after events that have led them to be the target of online vitriol (whether this is deserved or not).  It is a really interesting insight into the people post the events, and some where I remember them happening (an example being the woman who tweeted prior to her flight about getting aids) and that disappearing just as fast as it arrived.

Listening to these people discuss their side of the events, especially things that to us are a flash in the pan story evolve into something that destroys and reshapes other peoples lives.
