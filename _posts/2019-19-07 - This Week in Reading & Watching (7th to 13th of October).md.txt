# This Week in Reading & Watching (7th to 13th of October 2019)

**Illness struck, so this week was mostly from home** on the sofa watching Netflix, smashing the xbox controller whenever it judged me for watching too long.

**Between two Ferns - The Movie** (Netflix)

This was fun, and I love the Funny or Die shorts that are on YouTube, but I think this was definitely a one and done film, I don't think I would ever return to it.  It definitely had some fantastically funny moments but I think this would have been better as a set of new Between two Ferns interviews that were done as a netflix exclusive.

**The Big Short - Steve Carrell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt (Netflix)**

In the same vain as Vice that I watched last week, this takes the docudrama angle on the lead up to the Financial Crash of 2008.  Following several different hedge fund managers and bank salesman it shows them seeing the corrupt nature of the mortgage backed securities and how they see it coming and profit from it.

Whilst it is a eye opening watch and shows how morally bankrupt these people were at the time it is done with a dark comedy, keeping the story well paced.

**El Camino, A Breaking Bad Story - Aaron Paul, Bryan Cranston (Netflix)**

Following straight on from the series Breaking Bad, this film plays out more as a double stuffed episode.  Paced identically to an episode of Breaking Bad, it hardly feels like a 2 hour film.  This felt well paced, an excellent additoon to the Breaking Bad story without pandering to the fans.

There are some absolutely amazing camera shots, especially early on with the Swat Team convoy, and later with the apartment overview shot.  The camera work in this was amazing.

**Batman - Killing Joke - Alan Moore, Brian Bolland [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/batman-the-killing-joke-deluxe-edition/brian-bolland/alan-moore/9781401216672)**

After watching the Joker, I thought I would go back to my Collection and dig out some Joker heavy series that lean on more interesting and esoteric approaches to the Villian (And batman himself).  Killing Joke is a fantastic one-shot book that leans on the "One Bad Day" which the film also leans on.  The film Joker also leans on this by having the scene of the Jokers rise run alongside the killing of Thomas and Martha Wayne showing that both men having "One Bad Day" lead to two very different situations.

The artwork from Bolland within Killing Joke is absolutely pheonomenal, and you can see the strengths of his 2000AD work shining through. 

**Batman - Arkham Asylum - Grant Morrison, Dave McKean [Waterstones](https://www.waterstones.com/book/batman-arkham-asylum-25th-anniversary/grant-morrison/9781401251246)**

Another esoteric take on a Batman/Joker heavy story.  This one is a heavily cerebral story with an abstract art style which can be off putting.  I have read this several times now, having got my copy of this when I met Dave Mckean and he signed it for me, and I find it both fantastic in places and then extremely dated in others.  It feels like the first steps into computer processed artwork and some of it screams late eighties and it can be quite off putting.

Other parts are amazingly well done, and McKean highlights the nightmarish, slipping from reality elements of the Asylum and Morrison gives a brilliant gothic tale of the beginnings of the Asylum.  McKean also draws the most terrifying Joker I have ever seen.
